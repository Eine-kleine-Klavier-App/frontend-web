// Shared spring presets — the single source of truth for all state-driven motion (DESIGN.md §3.5).
// A component inlining its own stiffness/damping is the same review defect as a hardcoded hex.
//
// Why springs, not durations: macOS-grade smoothness comes from CONTINUITY, not from an easing
// curve. A spring is a physical value moving toward a goal; change the goal mid-flight (toggle
// again, reverse, spam a button) and it retargets from its CURRENT position AND velocity — never
// jumps, never restarts, never queues. Its "duration" emerges from distance, which is exactly why
// it feels physical. All three presets are tuned to settle with NO visible oscillation; any
// overshoot you see is real momentum from a fast interaction, never baked into the curve.
//
// Two shapes of the same config:
//   - `SPRING_*`      → `SpringOptions` for `useSpring(value, SPRING_*)`.
//   - `spring*`       → `Transition` for `<motion.x transition={spring*}>` and `animate(el, kf, spring*)`.

// useLayoutSafeSpring — THE pattern for "this element has a springy/bouncy open-close feel, and
// it sits next to something else in normal layout flow (a flex/grid sibling, centered content,
// anything that reflows off this element's box)." Use it any time that combination shows up —
// it's not specific to any one panel.
//
// The problem it solves: a single bouncy spring value can't safely drive BOTH the decorative feel
// AND a layout-affecting CSS property (width/height/flex-basis/grid-template-columns/...) at once
// — every bounce/overshoot/anticipation in that value reflows the sibling too, visibly pushing
// whatever's next to it in lockstep with the decoration. Clamping the SAME bouncy value to its
// resting bounds only band-aids the common case — an interrupted/retargeted spring can still
// momentarily inherit enough velocity to slip past a clamp before it's damped out.
//
// The fix is structural, not a clamp: run TWO INDEPENDENT spring animations toward the same
// open/closed target from the same intent.
//   - `layout` — CRITICALLY DAMPED (damping >= 2*sqrt(stiffness)): a spring at or above critical
//     damping is mathematically incapable of overshooting past its target, by construction, in
//     every case including interruption/retargeting — not just the common start-from-rest one.
//     This is the ONLY value allowed to drive a layout-affecting CSS property.
//   - `visual` — whatever spring you want (bouncy, given extra open/close velocity for a kick or
//     overshoot) — drives ONLY `transform`/`opacity` on an element that does not itself affect any
//     sibling's box (e.g. absolutely positioned, or already isolated from layout flow).
// A defensive `[0,1]` clamp still sits on `layout`'s consumer side as belt-and-braces, but it
// should never actually engage in normal operation — critical damping already guarantees it.
//
// INVARIANT: `layout` must reach its target AT LEAST AS FAST AS `visual`, ideally sooner. Critical
// damping removes overshoot but is inherently SLOWER to approach the target than an underdamped
// spring at the same stiffness — with similar stiffness on both, `layout` visibly finishes later
// and content keeps reflowing after the panel's own edge already looks settled. Default `layout`
// stiffness is set well above typical `visual` stiffness so it reliably leads; if you pass a
// custom `visualSpring`, also pass a `layoutSpring` with meaningfully higher stiffness.
