// Per-voice colours (MuseScore-style), aligned with the DESIGN.md voice tokens

// score, and its insert-ghost preview — all three read from the SAME resolved color so they
// never drift out of sync. Defaults cycle through this palette by voice index; the user can
// override any voice with an arbitrary custom color (stored separately, checked first).
